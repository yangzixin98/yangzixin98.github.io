I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [Guanghua School of Management, Peking University](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/index.htm), under the supervision of Professor [Xiaojun Song](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/conjsxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&wbtreeid=1099&user_id=sxj) and Professor [Jihai Yu](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/conjsxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&wbtreeid=1099&user_id=jihai.yu). I obtained my bachelor degree in Statistics from Beijing Normal University in 2020.

My research interests lie in spatial and network econometrics. My current research focuses on formal specification, testing and estimation of nonparametric network and social interaction models. I also work on specification tests for quantile and expectile regressions.

You can find my CV here.

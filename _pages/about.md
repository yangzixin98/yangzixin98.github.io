I work in [School of Statistics and Data Science](https://ssds.sufe.edu.cn) at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. I got my Ph.D. degree in Economics (Statistics) from [Guanghua School of Management, Peking University](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/index.htm) in 2025, under the supervision of Professors [Xiaojun Song](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/conjsxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&wbtreeid=1099&user_id=sxj) and [Jihai Yu](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/conjsxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&wbtreeid=1099&user_id=jihai.yu). I obtained my bachelor degree in Statistics from Beijing Normal University in 2020.

My research interests lie in spatial and network econometrics. My current research focuses on non-/semiparametric econometric theory for network and social interaction models. I also work on specification tests for quantile and expectile regressions.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [Guanghua School of Management, Peking University](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/index.htm), under the supervision of Professors [Xiaojun Song](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/conjsxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&wbtreeid=1099&user_id=sxj) and [Jihai Yu](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/conjsxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&wbtreeid=1099&user_id=jihai.yu). I obtained my bachelor degree in Statistics from Beijing Normal University in 2020.

My research interests lie in spatial and network econometrics. My current research focuses on non-/semiparametric econometric theory for network and social interaction models. I also work on specification tests for quantile and expectile regressions.

I am on the **2024/25 academic job market**.
